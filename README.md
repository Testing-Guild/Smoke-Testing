## What is Smoke Testing?

Smoke testing is a software development technique used to assess the basic functionality of a new software build. It's a **shallow but rapid** test designed to identify critical issues that would prevent further testing. 

Here's a breakdown of smoke testing's role in the software development lifecycle (SDLC):

* **Early Detection:** Smoke tests are typically run at the beginning of the testing process, before more in-depth functional testing. This allows developers to catch major bugs early on, saving valuable time and resources that would be wasted on testing a fundamentally broken build.
* **Time-to-Market Advantage:** In today's fast-paced development environment, getting software to market quickly is crucial. Smoke testing helps achieve this goal by identifying critical issues early, preventing them from delaying the release process.
* **Agile Development:** Smoke testing is particularly beneficial in Agile methodologies where frequent builds are produced. By running smoke tests on each new build, developers can ensure ongoing stability and catch regressions quickly. 

**Benefits of Smoke Testing:**

* **Early Bug Identification:** Smoke tests prioritize testing core functionalities, allowing for the swift identification of showstopper bugs that would halt further testing.
* **Improved Software Quality:** By addressing critical bugs early, smoke testing contributes to a more stable and robust software product.
* **Efficient Resource Allocation:** Smoke tests help determine if a build is even worth further testing, preventing wasted time and effort on fundamentally flawed builds.

**Analogy: Car Smoke Test**

Imagine testing a new car before sending it to the dealership. A smoke test in this context would involve checking the essentials: engine starting, proper steering, and basic driving functionality. Similar to software testing, more intricate features like air conditioning or entertainment systems would be examined later.

**Smoke Testing vs. Full Testing:**

It's important to remember that smoke testing is not a replacement for comprehensive software testing. It's a preliminary check to ensure the software is basically functional. More thorough testing follows to identify detailed bugs and ensure overall software quality.

**Terminology:**

Smoke testing is also referred to as **build verification testing** or **confidence testing**.

**Origins of the Term:**

The term "smoke test" comes from hardware testing, where a device is considered to have passed the smoke test if it doesn't literally catch fire when powered on for the first time. 
## When to Use Smoke Testing?

Smoke testing is a ubiquitous technique employed throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to verify a build's basic functionality. Here are key scenarios where smoke testing shines:

* **New Build Deployment:** Every time a new build is deployed, smoke testing is the first line of defense. It ensures the build functions at a fundamental level before proceeding with further testing. If critical functionalities fail the smoke test, the build is flagged for rectification before wasting resources on in-depth testing.

* **Code Changes:**  Smoke testing becomes crucial after any significant code changes. This could be the introduction of new features, bug fixes, or code refactoring. Smoke tests ensure these changes haven't unintentionally broken core functionalities.

* **Start of Testing Cycle:** Smoke testing is the ideal starting point for any testing cycle. It provides a quick sanity check, revealing any major issues that would impede further testing efforts. By identifying these problems early, the testing team can prioritize their efforts and avoid wasting time on a potentially broken build.

* **Regression Testing:**  Before embarking on regression testing, which verifies if fixed bugs haven't re-emerged, smoke testing plays a vital role. It ensures the build is stable enough to proceed with regression testing, preventing the introduction of new regressions during the process.

* **Agile Development:** In Agile methodologies with frequent deployments, smoke testing is a cornerstone practice.  It helps maintain stability by catching regressions quickly after each new sprint delivers code changes.

**Beyond Initial Checks:**

While smoke testing focuses on core functionalities, it can be expanded to cover critical integrations with other systems or external APIs. This ensures a more holistic view of the build's health and functionality.

**Remember:**

Smoke testing is not a substitute for comprehensive testing. It's a rapid assessment to identify critical issues and prevent wasted time on non-functional builds.  

**In Conclusion:**

By strategically incorporating smoke testing throughout the SDLC, development teams can ensure build stability, catch regressions early, and ultimately deliver higher quality software products. 

## The Purpose and Importance of Smoke Testing
**Core Purpose: Build Stability Assessment**

The primary focus of smoke testing is to determine if a build has reached a minimum level of stability to warrant further testing.  Imagine a smoke test as a quick health check for the software.  If the software can't even perform basic tasks, then delving into deeper testing wouldn't be productive.

**Broad Scope, Not Bug Hunting**

Smoke tests encompass a wide range of essential functionalities, providing a broad overview of the build's health. They are not designed to meticulously uncover every bug; instead, they focus on identifying critical issues that would prevent the software from functioning at a basic level.

**Early Warning System for Broken Builds**

Smoke tests act as an early warning system, catching major problems that might otherwise go unnoticed.  If a smoke test fails, it's a strong indication of a potentially broken build with missing files, fundamental errors, or regressions. This allows developers to address these issues promptly before wasting time on further testing.

**Benefits of Smoke Testing:**

* **Improved Efficiency:** By identifying unstable builds early, smoke testing prevents wasted time and resources that would be spent on in-depth testing of a fundamentally flawed build.

## How Smoke Testing Works

Smoke testing, while seemingly straightforward, involves a well-defined process to ensure its effectiveness. Here's a breakdown of the key steps involved in smoke testing:

**1. Build Deployment:**

The process begins with the development team deploying a new build to a designated testing environment. This environment should mimic the production environment as closely as possible to ensure realistic testing conditions.

**2. Smoke Test Suite Design:**

The testing team, often in collaboration with developers, designs a set of smoke test cases. These test cases target core functionalities that are critical to the overall software's functionality. The goal is to achieve broad coverage without getting bogged down in intricate details.

**3. Smoke Test Automation (Optional):**

For efficiency and consistency, smoke testing is a prime candidate for automation. Automated smoke tests can be integrated into the continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, enabling faster feedback loops and reduced reliance on manual testing efforts.

**4. Smoke Test Execution:**

Whether manual or automated, the smoke test suite is executed against the deployed build. This involves running the test cases and observing the results.

**5. Pass/Fail Criteria Evaluation:**

Smoke tests typically have clear pass/fail criteria. The testing team evaluates the results to determine if the build has passed or failed the smoke test. A successful smoke test indicates that the build is stable enough to proceed with further testing.

**6. Reporting and Remediation:**

The outcome of the smoke test is documented and communicated to the development team.  In case of a failed smoke test, the development team investigates the cause of the failure and implements necessary fixes before re-deploying the build for another smoke testing attempt.

**7. Test Environment Cleanup:**

After smoke testing is complete, the testing environment may require cleanup. This might involve stopping servers, deleting temporary files, or resetting database tables to prepare the environment for the next round of testing.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Smoke testing should be a quick process, with each test case designed for rapid execution.
* The scope of smoke testing can be adjusted based on the project's needs and complexity.
* Smoke testing is an ongoing process throughout the development cycle, not just a one-time activity.
